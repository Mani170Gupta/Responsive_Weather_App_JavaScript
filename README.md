Weather App with Responsive Design and API Integration

Designed and developed a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Grid, and Flexbox layouts to ensure compatibility across multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Implemented a dynamic user interface that adjusts the layout based on screen size using CSS media queries to enhance user experience on various devices.
Integrated the WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data (current conditions, temperature, wind speed, air quality, etc.) based on user input (city name).
Utilized async/await for handling asynchronous API requests to retrieve weather information and implemented error handling to manage invalid inputs or failed requests.
Applied JavaScript DOM manipulation to dynamically display weather data, including air quality index, temperature, wind speed, humidity, cloud coverage, and UV index.
Ensured data validation to handle cases where the city name might be incorrect or not found, providing helpful feedback to the user.
